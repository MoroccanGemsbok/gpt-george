# GPT George

## Inspiration
According to Juniper Research, there were over 4 billion voice assistants in use in 2020, with the amount projected to double in 2024. Needless to say, voice assistants have now become a daily part of our lives, whether it be on our phones, laptops, or cars. However, many voice assistants have limitations such as inaccurate information and software integration problems, making them less effective. Over the 36 hours at the UC Berkeley AI Hackathon, we set out to develop a solution to this problem.

## What it does
GPT George is a groundbreaking voice assistant that combines the functionalities of popular voice assistants, such as Siri and Google Assistant, with the remarkable capabilities of GPT-4 and the emotional intelligence of Hume AI. It allows users to effortlessly perform a wide range of tasks, including checking the weather, sending emails, getting news updates, and accessing location-based services. However, what sets GPT George apart is its ability to engage in context-rich conversations thanks to its LLM-powered response engine, providing more meaningful and accurate responses to user queries. Additionally, the integration of Hume AI enables GPT George to detect and adapt to the user's emotions, tailoring its output to create a personalized and empathetic experience.

## How we built it
We began building GPT George by harnessing the power of GPT-4, a highly advanced natural language processing model, to handle the conversational aspects and provide accurate responses. To enable emotion detection and personalization, we integrated Hume AI, an innovative system that analyzes voice patterns and inflections to understand the user's emotions, allowing GPT George to generate outputs tailored to the user's mood. We developed the voice recognition and synthesis using OpenAI's Whisper AI and Azure's text-to-speak neural networks.

## Challenges we ran into
While developing GPT George, we encountered several challenges that pushed us to explore innovative solutions. Integrating the complex GPT-4 model into a real-time voice assistant system required significant computational resources and careful optimization to ensure smooth and responsive interactions. Additionally, developing the voice recognition and synthesis models proved to be quite a challenge to implement. Overcoming these challenges required a combination of technical expertise, rigorous experimentation, and collaborative problem-solving.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Throughout the development process, we achieved several significant accomplishments that we are immensely proud of. First and foremost, we successfully integrated GPT-4 technology into a voice assistant, empowering GPT George with contextual understanding and enhanced conversational abilities. Furthermore, our implementation of Hume AI enabled GPT George to recognize and respond to the user's emotions, forging a deeper connection between the user and the voice assistant. Unlike other impersonal voice assistants, we aim for GPT George to act less as a user's tool, and more like a partner that can aid the user in anything they do. Overall, we are proud to have created a sophisticated voice assistant all from scratch this weekend that combines cutting-edge technologies to deliver an exceptional user experience.

## What we learned
The development of GPT George allowed us to acquire valuable insights and knowledge, such as integrating advanced natural language processing models like GPT-4 into real-world applications. Exploring the capabilities of Hume AI provided us with valuable experience in leveraging emotional intelligence to create personalized user experiences. We learned more about the implementation of speech services in an app and the challenges associated with them. We also learned the importance of collaboration, perseverance, and adaptability when tackling complex challenges in the field of AI development.

## What's next for GPT George
GPT George represents a significant leap forward in voice assistant technology, but our journey does not end here. We plan to continue refining the contextual understanding of GPT George, enabling it to engage in even more nuanced and meaningful conversations. We will further enhance the emotional intelligence capabilities of Hume AI, allowing GPT George to adapt and respond with heightened sensitivity to the user's emotional state. Additionally, we aim to integrate GPT George with various smart home devices and platforms, expanding its reach and utility in users' daily lives. By continuously innovating and incorporating the latest advancements, we strive to make GPT George an indispensable companion that truly understands and serves the needs of its users.
